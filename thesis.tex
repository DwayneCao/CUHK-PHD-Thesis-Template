% GSAS: "all margins should be at least 1 inch."
\usepackage[margin={1.2in}]{geometry}
% If you want asymmetric margins for two-sided documents, use the "twoside"
% option, as in
% \usepackage[top=1in,bottom=1.5in,left=1in,right=1.5in,twoside]{geometry} The
% left and right options become inner and outer margins The default horizontal
% latex margin ratio is 2:3. The default vertical top:bottom margin ratio is 2:3
% also. You can also set it directly by passing the hmarginratio option to the
% geometry package, as in
% \usepackage[top=1in,left=1in,vmarginratio=2:3,hmarginratio=2:5,twoside]{geometry}

% Appendix package. Not necessary, but it does make managing appendices easier
